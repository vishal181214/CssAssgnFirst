            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascending Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS describe how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
            <li><span class="del">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="bgcolor"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
            <li><span class="underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <ul class="unlist">
            <h3>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h3>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1.</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
            <li>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS files. However, <span class="bgcolor">in this 
                tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
                for you to try it yourself.

        </ul>
        <p class="text">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style multiple elements, ID, on the other
            hand, applies a style to one unique element, ID is also special is that you can use a special URL to link directly to
            an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="text">In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, 
            a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
        </p>
        <p class="text">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements
            to which a style should be applied.
